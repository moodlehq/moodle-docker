# moodle-docker: Docker Containers for Moodle Developers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/moodlehq/moodle-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/moodlehq/moodle-docker/branches)

This repository contains Docker configuration aimed at Moodle developers and testers to easily deploy a testing environment for Moodle.

## Features:
* All supported database servers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Micosoft SQL Server, Oracle XE)
* Behat/Selenium configuration for Firefox and Chrome
* Catch-all smtp server and web interface to messages using [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/)
* All PHP Extensions enabled configured for external services (e.g. solr, ldap)
* All supported PHP versions
* Zero-configuration approach
* Backed by [automated tests](https://travis-ci.org/moodlehq/moodle-docker/branches)

## Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
* 3.25GB of RAM (if you choose [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup#prerequisites) as db server)

## Quick start

```bash
# Set up path to Moodle code
export MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT=/path/to/moodle/code
# Choose a db server (Currently supported: pgsql, mariadb, mysql, mssql, oracle)
export MOODLE_DOCKER_DB=pgsql

# Ensure customized config.php for the Docker containers is in place
cp config.docker-template.php $MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT/config.php

# Start up containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose up -d

# Wait for DB to come up (important for oracle/mssql)
bin/moodle-docker-wait-for-db

# Work with the containers (see below)
# [..]

# Shut down and destroy containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose down
```

## Use containers for running behat tests

```bash
# Initialize behat environment
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/init.php
# [..]

# Run behat tests
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/run.php --tags=@auth_manual
Running single behat site:
Moodle 3.4dev (Build: 20171006), 33a3ec7c9378e64c6f15c688a3c68a39114aa29d

```

Notes:
* The behat faildump directory is exposed at http://localhost:8000/_/faildumps/.

## Use containers for running phpunit tests

```bash
# Initialize phpunit environment
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
# [..]

# Run phpunit tests
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver vendor/bin/phpunit auth_manual_testcase auth/manual/tests/manual_test.php
Moodle 3.4dev (Build: 20171006), 33a3ec7c9378e64c6f15c688a3c68a39114aa29d

..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)

Time: 4.45 seconds, Memory: 38.00MB

OK (2 tests, 7 assertions)
```

## Use containers for manual testing

```bash
# Initialize Moodle database for manual testing
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/cli/install_database.php --agree-license --fullname="Docker moodle" --shortname="docker_moodle" --adminpass="test" --adminemail="admin@example.com"
```

Notes:
* Moodle is configured to listen on `http://localhost:8000/`.
* Mailhog is listening on `http://localhost:8000/_/mail` to view emails which Moodle has sent out.
* The admin `username` you need to use for logging in is `admin` by default. You can customize it by passing `--adminuser='myusername'`

## Using VNC to view behat tests

If `MOODLE_DOCKER_SELENIUM_VNC_PORT` is defined, selenium will expose a VNC session on the port specified so behat tests can be viewed in progress.

For example, if you set `MOODLE_DOCKER_SELENIUM_VNC_PORT` to 5900..
1. Download a VNC client: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
2. With the containers running, enter 0.0.0.0:5900 as the port in VNC Viewer. You will be prompted for a password. The password is 'secret'.
3. You should be able to see an empty Desktop. When you run any Behat tests a browser will popup and you will see the tests execute.

## Stop and restart containers

`bin/moodle-docker-compose down` which was used above after using the containers stops and destroys the containers. If you want to use your containers continuously for manual testing or development without starting them up from scratch everytime you use them, you can also just stop without destroying them. With this approach, you can restart your containers sometime later, they will keep their data and won't be destroyed completely until you run `bin/moodle-docker-compose down`.

```bash
# Stop containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose stop

# Restart containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose start
```

## Environment variables

You can change the configuration of the docker images by setting various environment variables before calling `bin/moodle-docker-compose up`.

## Advanced usage

As can be seen in [bin/moodle-docker-compose](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/blob/master/bin/moodle-docker-compose),
this repo is just a series of docker-compose configurations and light wrapper which make use of companion docker images. Each part
is designed to be reusable and you are encouraged to use the docker[-compose] commands as needed.

## Companion docker images

The following Moodle customised docker images are close companions of this project:

* [moodle-php-apache](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-php-apache): Apache/PHP Environment preconfigured for all Moodle environments
* [moodle-db-mssql](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-db-mssql): Microsoft SQL Server for Linux configured for Moodle
* [moodle-db-oracle](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-db-oracle): Oracle XE configured for Moodle
