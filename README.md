# moodle-docker: Docker Containers for Moodle Developers
[![moodle-docker CI](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains Docker configuration aimed at Moodle developers and testers to easily deploy a testing environment for Moodle.

## Features:
* All supported database servers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Micosoft SQL Server, Oracle XE)
* Behat/Selenium configuration for Firefox and Chrome
* Catch-all smtp server and web interface to messages using [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit)
* All PHP Extensions enabled configured for external services (e.g. solr, ldap)
* All supported PHP versions
* Zero-configuration approach
* Backed by [automated tests](https://travis-ci.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/branches)

## Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2) installed if your Docker CLI version does not support `docker compose` command.
* It's recommended to always run the latest versions of each, but at the minimum Docker v20.10.15 and Docker Compose v2.5.0 should be used.
* 3.25GB of RAM (if you choose [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup#prerequisites) as db server)

## Quick start

```bash
# Change ./moodle to your /path/to/moodle if you already have it checked out
export MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT=./moodle

# Choose a db server (Currently supported: pgsql, mariadb, mysql, mssql, oracle)
export MOODLE_DOCKER_DB=pgsql

# Get Moodle code, you could select another version branch (skip this if you already got the code)
git clone -b [MOODLE_BRANCH] git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git $MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT

# Ensure customized config.php for the Docker containers is in place
cp config.docker-template.php $MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT/config.php

# Start up containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose up -d

# Wait for DB to come up (important for oracle/mssql)
bin/moodle-docker-wait-for-db

# Work with the containers (see below)
# [..]

# Shut down and destroy containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose down
```
## Run several Moodle instances

By default, the script will load a single instance. If you want to run two
or more different versions of Moodle at the same time, you have to add this
environment variable prior running any of the steps at `Quick start`:

```bash
# Define a project name; it will appear as a prefix on container names.
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=moodle34

# Use a different public web port from those already taken
export MOODLE_DOCKER_WEB_PORT=1234

# [..] run all "Quick steps" now
```

Having set up several Moodle instances, you need to have set up
the environment variable `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to just refer
to the instance you expect to. See
[envvars](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/)
to see more about `docker-compose` environment variables.

## Use containers for running behat tests

```bash
# Initialize behat environment
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/init.php
# [..]

# Run behat tests
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec -u www-data webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/run.php --tags=@auth_manual
Running single behat site:

1m35.32s (41.60Mb)
```

Notes:

* The behat faildump directory is exposed at http://localhost:8000/_/faildumps/.
* Use `MOODLE_DOCKER_BROWSER` to switch the browser you want to run the test against.
  You need to recreate your containers using `bin/moodle-docker-compose` as described below, if you change it.

## Use containers for running phpunit tests

```bash
# Initialize phpunit environment
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
# [..]

# Run phpunit tests

bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver vendor/bin/phpunit auth/manual/tests/manual_test.php
Moodle 4.0.4 (Build: 20220912), ef7a51dcb8e805a6889974b04d3154ba8bd874f2
Php: 7.3.33, pgsql: 11.15 (Debian 11.15-1.pgdg90+1), OS: Linux 5.10.0-11-amd64 x86_64
PHPUnit 9.5.13 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)

Time: 00:00.304, Memory: 72.50 MB

OK (2 tests, 7 assertions)
```

Notes:
* If you want to run tests with code coverage reports:
```
# Build component configuration
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/util.php --buildcomponentconfigs
# Execute tests for component
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php -d pcov.enabled=1 -d pcov.directory=. vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration reportbuilder --coverage-text
```
* See available [Command-Line Options](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/textui.html#textui-clioptions) for further info

## Use containers for manual testing

```bash
# Initialize Moodle database for manual testing
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/cli/install_database.php --agree-license --fullname="Docker moodle" --shortname="docker_moodle" --summary="Docker moodle site" --adminpass="test" --adminemail="admin@example.com"
```

Notes:
* Moodle is configured to listen on `http://localhost:8000/`.
* Mailpit is listening on `http://localhost:8000/_/mail` to view emails which Moodle has sent out.
* The admin `username` you need to use for logging in is `admin` by default. You can customize it by passing `--adminuser='myusername'`
* During manual testing, if you are facing that your Moodle site is logging
 you off continuously, putting the correct credentials, clean all cookies
 for your Moodle site URL (usually `localhost`) from your browser.

## Use containers for running behat tests for the Moodle App

In order to run Behat tests for the Moodle App, you need to install the [local_moodleappbehat](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodleappbehat) plugin in your Moodle site. Everything else should be the same as running standard Behat tests for Moodle. Make sure to filter tests using the `@app` tag.

The Behat tests will be run against a container serving the mobile application, you have two options here:

1. Use a Docker image that includes the application code. You need to specify the `MOODLE_DOCKER_APP_VERSION` env variable and the [moodlehq/moodleapp](https://hub.docker.com/r/moodlehq/moodleapp) image will be downloaded from Docker Hub. You can read about the available images in [Moodle App Docker Images](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/setup/docker-images) (for Behat, you'll want to run the ones with the `-test` suffix).

2. Use a local copy of the application code and serve it through Docker, similar to how the Moodle site is being served. Set the `MOODLE_DOCKER_APP_PATH` env variable to the codebase in you file system. This will assume that you've already initialized the app calling `npm install` locally.

For both options, you also need to set `MOODLE_DOCKER_BROWSER` to "chrome".

```bash
# Install local_moodleappbehat plugin
git clone https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodleappbehat "$MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT/local/moodleappbehat"

# Initialize behat environment
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/init.php
# (you should see "Configured app tests for version X.X.X" here)

# Run behat tests
bin/moodle-docker-compose exec -u www-data webserver php admin/tool/behat/cli/run.php --tags="@app&&@mod_login"
Running single behat site:
Moodle 4.0dev (Build: 20200615), a2b286ce176fbe361f0889abc8f30f043cd664ae
Php: 7.2.30, pgsql: 11.8 (Debian 11.8-1.pgdg90+1), OS: Linux 5.3.0-61-generic x86_64
Server OS "Linux", Browser: "chrome"
Browser specific fixes have been applied. See http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Acceptance_testing#Browser_specific_fixes

.....................................................................

4 scenarios (4 passed)
69 steps (69 passed)
3m3.17s (55.02Mb)
```

If you are going with the second option, this *can* be used for local development of the Moodle App, given that the `moodleapp` container serves the app on the local 8100 port. However, this is intended to run Behat tests that require interacting with a local Moodle environment. Normal development should be easier calling `npm start` in the host system.

By all means, if you don't want to have npm installed locally you can go full Docker executing the following commands before starting the containers:

```
docker run --volume $MOODLE_DOCKER_APP_PATH:/app --workdir /app bash -c "npm install"
```

You can learn more about writing tests for the app in [Acceptance testing for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/testing/acceptance-testing).

## Using VNC to view behat tests

If `MOODLE_DOCKER_SELENIUM_VNC_PORT` is defined, selenium will expose a VNC session on the port specified so behat tests can be viewed in progress.

For example, if you set `MOODLE_DOCKER_SELENIUM_VNC_PORT` to 5900..
1. Download a VNC client: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
2. With the containers running, enter 0.0.0.0:5900 as the port in VNC Viewer. You will be prompted for a password. The password is 'secret'.
3. You should be able to see an empty Desktop. When you run any [Javascript requiring Behat tests](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/behat#javascript) (e.g. those tagged `@javascript`) a browser will popup and you will see the tests execute.

## Stop and restart containers

`bin/moodle-docker-compose down` which was used above after using the containers stops and destroys the containers. If you want to use your containers continuously for manual testing or development without starting them up from scratch everytime you use them, you can also just stop without destroying them. With this approach, you can restart your containers sometime later, they will keep their data and won't be destroyed completely until you run `bin/moodle-docker-compose down`.

```bash
# Stop containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose stop

# Restart containers
bin/moodle-docker-compose start
```

## Environment variables

You can change the configuration of the docker images by setting various environment variables **before** calling `bin/moodle-docker-compose up`.
When you change them, use `bin/moodle-docker-compose down && bin/moodle-docker-compose up -d` to recreate your environment.

| Environment Variable                      | Mandatory | Allowed values                        | Default value | Notes                                                                        |

| `MOODLE_DOCKER_DB_PORT`                   | no        | any integer value                     | none          | If you want to bind to any host IP different from the default 127.0.0.1, you can specify it with the bind_ip:port format (0.0.0.0 means bind to all). Username is "moodle" (or "sa" for mssql) and password is "m@0dl3ing". |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_WEB_HOST`                  | no        | any valid hostname                    | localhost     | The hostname for web                                |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_WEB_PORT`                  | no        | any integer value (or bind_ip:integer)| 127.0.0.1:8000| The port number for web. If set to 0, no port is used.<br/>If you want to bind to any host IP different from the default 127.0.0.1, you can specify it with the bind_ip:port format (0.0.0.0 means bind to all) |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_SELENIUM_REPOSITORY`       | no        | selenium, seleniarm                   | OS-dependent  | The repository to use for Selenium images |

Similar to MOODLE_DOCKER_WEB_PORT, you can optionally define the host IP to bind to. If you just set the port, VNC binds to 127.0.0.1 |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_APP_PATH`                  | no        | path on your file system              | not set       | If set and the chrome browser is selected, it will start an instance of the Moodle app from your local codebase |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_APP_VERSION`               | no        | a valid [app docker image version](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_App_Docker_images) | not set       | If set will start an instance of the Moodle app if the chrome browser is selected |
| `MOODLE_DOCKER_TIMEOUT_FACTOR`            | no        | any integer value                     | 1             | If set the timeouts in behat will be multiplied by the factor                |

In addition to that, `MOODLE_DOCKER_RUNNING=1` env variable is defined and available
in the webserver container to flag being run by `moodle-docker`. Developer
can use this to conditionally make changes in `config.php`. The common case is
to load test-specific configuration:
```
// Load moodle-docker config file if we are in moodle-docker environment
if (getenv('MOODLE_DOCKER_RUNNING')) {
    require_once(__DIR__ . '/config.docker-template.php');
}

require_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php'); // Do not edit.
```

## Local customisations

In some situations you may wish to add local customisations, such as including additional containers, or changing existing containers.

This can be accomplished by specifying a `local.yml`, which will be added in and loaded with the existing yml configuration files automatically. For example:

``` file="local.yml"
version: "2"
services:

  # Add the adminer image at the latest tag on port 8080:8080
  adminer:
    image: adminer:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - "db"

  # Modify the webserver image to add another volume:
  webserver:
    volumes:
      - "/opt/data:/opt/data:cached"
```

## Using XDebug for live debugging

The XDebug PHP Extension is not included in this setup and there are reasons not to include it by default.

However, if you want to work with XDebug, especially for live debugging, you can add XDebug to a running webserver container easily:

```
# Install XDebug extension with PECL
moodle-docker-compose exec webserver pecl install xdebug

# Set some wise setting for live debugging - change this as needed
read -r -d '' conf <<'EOF'
; Settings for Xdebug Docker configuration
xdebug.mode = debug
xdebug.client_host = host.docker.internal
; Some IDEs (eg PHPSTORM, VSCODE) may require configuring an IDE key, uncomment if needed
; xdebug.idekey=MY_FAV_IDE_KEY
EOF
moodle-docker-compose exec webserver bash -c "echo '$conf' >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini"

# Enable XDebug extension in Apache and restart the webserver container
moodle-docker-compose exec webserver docker-php-ext-enable xdebug
moodle-docker-compose restart webserver
```

While setting these XDebug settings depending on your local need, please take special care of the value of `xdebug.client_host` which is needed to connect from the container to the host. The given value `host.docker.internal` is a special DNS name for this purpose within Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac. If you are running on another Docker environment, you might want to try the value `localhost` instead or even set the hostname/IP of the host directly. Please turn off the firewall or open the port used in the `xdebug.client_port`.

Open the port (9003 is the default one) by using the example command for Linux Ubuntu:
```
sudo ufw allow 9003
```


After these commands, XDebug ist enabled and ready to be used in the webserver container.
If you want to disable and re-enable XDebug during the lifetime of the webserver container, you can achieve this with these additional commands:

```
# Disable XDebug extension in Apache and restart the webserver container
moodle-docker-compose exec webserver sed -i 's/^zend_extension=/; zend_extension=/' /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini
moodle-docker-compose restart webserver

# Enable XDebug extension in Apache and restart the webserver container
moodle-docker-compose exec webserver sed -i 's/^; zend_extension=/zend_extension=/' /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini
moodle-docker-compose restart webserver
```

## Advanced usage

As can be seen in [bin/moodle-docker-compose](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/blob/main/bin/moodle-docker-compose),
this repo is just a series of Docker Compose configurations and light wrapper which make use of companion docker images. Each part
is designed to be reusable and you are encouraged to use the docker [compose] commands as needed.

## Quick start with Gitpod

Gitpod is a free, cloud-based, development environment providing VS Code and a suitable development environment right in your browser.

When launching a workspace in Gitpod, it will automatically:

* Clone the Moodle repo into the `<workspace>/moodle` folder.
* Initialise the Moodle database.
* Start the Moodle webserver.

<p>
    <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        <img loading="lazy" src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" alt="Open in Gitpod" class="img_ev3q">
    </a>
</p>

> **IMPORTANT**: Gitpod is an alternative to local development and completely optional. We recommend setting up a local development environment if you plan to contribute regularly.

The Moodle Gitpod template supports the following environment variables:

* `MOODLE_REPOSITORY`. The Moodle repository to be cloned. The value should be URL encoded. If left undefined, the default repository `https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git` is used.
* `MOODLE_BRANCH`. The Moodle branch to be cloned. If left undefined, the default branch `main` is employed.
* `DATAFILE`. When specified, this feature URL initializes the Moodle site with essential data. The value should be URL encoded. The content of this file adheres to the [Behat generators format](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/generator#create-a-testing-scenario-using-behat-generators) for creating testing scenarios.
* `INSTALLADMINER`. Add this variable, set to any value, to install [adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).
* `CLONEALL`. If not set, a shallow clone is created, truncating the history to reduce the clone size. Set to `1` for a full clone.

For a practical demonstration, launch a Gitpod workspace with the 'main' branch patch for [MDL-79912](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79912). Simply open the following URL in your web browser (note that MOODLE_REPOSITORY should be URL encoded). The password for the **admin** user is **test**:

```
https://gitpod.io/#MOODLE_REPOSITORY=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsarjona%2Fmoodle.git,MOODLE_BRANCH=MDL-79912-main/https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker
```

To optimize your browsing experience, consider integrating the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) into your preferred web browser for added benefits. Afterward, install the Gitpod script, which can be accessed via the following URL: [Gitpod script](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sarjona/9fc728eb2d2b41a783ea03afd6a6161e/raw/gitpod.js). This script efficiently incorporates a button adjacent to each branch within the Moodle tracker, facilitating the effortless initiation of a Gitpod workspace tailored to the corresponding patch for the issue you're currently viewing.
